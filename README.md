# egSamsungTV

It's been done to death, but what's another Event Ghost Samsung TV plugin?

This works with Samsung 2016/2017 TVs that use websockets.  Tested as working on a UN82MU8000.  Supports around 240 possible key events.  Uses Wake On Lan to turn on the TV.

You need to add the wakeonlan and [samsungctl](https://github.com/Ape/samsungctl) (this is a modified version for Python 2.6) folders to either the folder this plugin is in, or %programfiles(x86)%\EventGhost\lib26\site-packages .
