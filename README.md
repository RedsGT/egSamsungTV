# egSamsungTV

It's been done to death, but what's another Event Ghost Samsung TV plugin?

This works with Samsung 2016/2017 TVs that use websockets.  Tested as working on a UN82MU8000.

You need to add the wakeonlan and [samsungctl](https://github.com/Ape/samsungctl) (this is a modified version for Pythin 2.7)
